title: Find your Okta domain
---

To find your Okta URL (also called an Okta domain):

1. Sign in to your Okta organization with your administrator account.

2. Look for the Okta domain in the global header located in the upper-right corner of the dashboard. ???

Your Okta domain looks like:

* `example.oktapreview.com`
* `example.okta.com`
* `example.okta-emea.com`

See [Okta Organizations](/docs/concepts/okta-organizations/) for more information on the types of Okta orgs.

> **Note:** Alternatively, find the welcome email in your inbox that you received when you signed up. The email contains your Okta URL.
